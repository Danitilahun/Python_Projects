In a broad sense propulsion is the\nact of changing the motion of a body. Propulsion mechanisms provide a force\nthat moves bodies that are initially at rest, changes a velocity, or overcomes\nretarding forces when a body is propelled through a medium. Jet propulsion is\na means of locomotion whereby a reaction force is imparted to a device by the\nmomentum of ejected matter.\nRocket propulsion is a class of jet propulsion that produces thrust by ejecting\nmatter stored in a \ufb02ying vehicle called the propellant. Duct propulsion is a class\nof jet propulsion and includes turbojets and ramjets; these engines are also com-\nmonly called air-breathing engines. Duct propulsion devices utilize mostly the\nsurrounding medium as the \u201cworking \ufb02uid,\u201d together with some vehicle-stored\nfuel. Combinations of rockets and duct propulsion devices can be attractive for\nsome narrow applications and one is brie\ufb02y described in this chapter.\nThe energy source most useful to rocket propulsion is chemical combustion.\nEnergy can also be supplied by solar radiation and, in the past, also by nuclear\nreaction. Accordingly, the various propulsion devices can be divided into chem-\nical propulsion, nuclear propulsion, and solar propulsion. Table 1\u20131 lists many\nof the important propulsion concepts according to their energy source and type\nof propellant or working \ufb02uid. Radiation energy can originate from sources other\nthan the sun and theoretically can cover the transmission of energy by microwave\nand laser beams, electromagnetic waves, and electrons, protons, and other par-\nticle beams from a transmitter to a \ufb02ying receiver. Nuclear energy is associated\nwith the transformations of atomic particles within the nucleus of atoms and\nusually is created by \ufb01ssion or fusion. Other energy sources, both internal (in the\nvehicle) and external, can be considered. The energy form found in the output\n1"}, {"chapter": "Chapter 1", "page": 2, "body": "TABLE 1\u20131.

The ejected mass can\nbe in a solid, liquid, or gaseous state. Often a combination of two or more of\nthese is ejected. At very high temperatures it can also be a plasma, which is an\nelectrically activated gas.\n1.1. DUCT JET PROPULSION\nThis class, also called air-breathing engines, comprises devices which have a duct\nto con\ufb01ne the \ufb02ow of air. They use oxygen from the air to burn fuel stored in\nthe \ufb02ight vehicle. The class includes turbojets, turbofans, ramjets, and pulsejets.\nThis class of propulsion is mentioned primarily to provide a comparison with\nrocket propulsion and a background for combination rocket\u2013duct engines, which\nare mentioned later. Table 1\u20132 compares several performance characteristics\nof speci\ufb01c chemical rockets with those of typical turbojets and ramjets. A high\nspeci\ufb01c impulse, which is a measure of performance to be de\ufb01ned later, is directly\nrelated to a long \ufb02ight range and thus indicates the superior range capability of air\nbreather engines over chemical rockets at relatively low altitude. The uniqueness\nof the rocket, for example, high thrust to weight, high thrust to frontal area, and\nnearly thrust independence of altitude, enables extremely long \ufb02ight ranges to be\nobtained in rare\ufb01ed air and in space.\nThe turbojet engine is the most common of ducted engines.

Thrust is produced\nby increasing the momentum of the air as it passes through the ramjet, basically as\nis accomplished in the turbojet and turbofan engines but without compressors or\nturbines. Figure 1\u20132 shows the basic components of one type of ramjet. Ramjets\nwith subsonic combustion and hydrocarbon fuel have an upper speed limit of\napproximately Mach 5; hydrogen fuel, with hydrogen cooling, raises this to at\nleast Mach 16. Ramjets with supersonic combustion are known as scramjets and\nhave \ufb02own in experimental vehicles.

The primary applications of\nramjets with subsonic combustion have been in shipboard and ground-launched\nantiaircraft missiles.

The supersonic \ufb02ight vehicle is a combination of a ramjet-driven\nhigh-speed airplane and a one- or two-stage rocket booster. It can travel at speeds\nup to a Mach number of 25 at altitudes of up to 50,000 m.\n1.2. ROCKET PROPULSION\nRocket propulsion systems can be classi\ufb01ed according to the type of energy\nsource (chemical, nuclear, or solar), the basic function (booster stage, sustainer\nor upper stages, attitude control, orbit station keeping, etc.), the type of vehicle\n(aircraft, missile, assisted takeoff, space vehicle, etc.), size, type of propellant,\ntype of construction, or number of rocket propulsion units used in a given vehicle.\nAnother way is to classify by the method of producing thrust. A thermody-\nnamic expansion of a gas is used in the majority of practical rocket propulsion\nconcepts. The internal energy of the gas is converted into the kinetic energy of\nthe exhaust \ufb02ow and the thrust is produced by the gas pressure on the surfaces\nexposed to the gas, as will be explained later. This same thermodynamic the-\nory and the same generic equipment (nozzle) is used for jet propulsion, rocket\npropulsion, nuclear propulsion, laser propulsion, solar-thermal propulsion, and\nsome types of electrical propulsion. Totally different methods of producing thrust"}, {"chapter": "Chapter 1", "page": 5, "body": "\nare used in other types of electric propulsion or by using a pendulum in a gravity\ngradient. As described below, these electric systems use magnetic and/or electric\n\ufb01elds to accelerate electrically charged molecules or atoms at very low densities.\nIt is also possible to obtain a very small acceleration by taking advantage of the\ndifference in gravitational attraction as a function of altitude, but this method is\nnot explained in this book.\nThe Chinese developed and used solid propellant in rocket missiles over 800\nyears ago, and military bombardment rockets were used frequently in the eigh-\nteenth and nineteenth centuries. However, the signi\ufb01cant developments of rocket\npropulsion took place in the twentieth century. Early pioneers included the Rus-\nsian Konstantin E. Ziolkowsky, who is credited with the fundamental rocket\n\ufb02ight equation and his 1903 proposals to build rocket vehicles. The German\nHermann Oberth developed a more detailed mathematical theory; he proposed\nmultistage vehicles for space \ufb02ight and fuel-cooled thrust chambers. The Amer-\nican Robert H. Goddard is credited with the \ufb01rst \ufb02ight using a liquid propellant\nrocket engine in 1926. An early book on the subject was written by the Viennese\nengineer Eugen S\u00a8anger. For rocket history see Refs. 1\u20131 to 1\u20138.\nChemical Rocket Propulsion\nThe energy from a high-pressure combustion reaction of propellant chemicals,\nusually a fuel and an oxidizing chemical, permits the heating of reaction product\ngases to very high temperatures (2500 to 4100\u25e6C or 4500 to 7400\u25e6F). These\ngases subsequently are expanded in a nozzle and accelerated to high velocities\n(1800 to 4300 m/sec or 5900 to 14,100 ft/sec). Since these gas temperatures are\nabout twice the melting point of steel, it is necessary to cool or insulate all the\nsurfaces that are exposed to the hot gases. According to the physical state of\nthe propellant, there are several different classes of chemical rocket propulsion\ndevices.\nLiquid propellant rocket engines use liquid propellants that are fed under pres-\nsure from tanks into a thrust chamber.\u2217 A typical pressure-fed liquid propellant\nrocket engine system is schematically shown in Fig. 1\u20133. The liquid bipropellant\nconsists of a liquid oxidizer (e.g., liquid oxygen) and a liquid fuel (e.g., kerosene).\nA monopropellant is a single liquid that contains both oxidizing and fuel species;\nit decomposes into hot gas when properly catalyzed. A large turbopump-fed liq-\nuid propellant rocket engine is shown in Fig. 1\u20134. Gas pressure feed systems are\nused mostly on low thrust, low total energy propulsion systems, such as those\nused for attitude control of \ufb02ying vehicles, often with more than one thrust cham-\nber per engine. Pump-fed liquid rocket systems are used typically in applications\nwith larger amounts of propellants and higher thrusts, such as in space launch\nvehicles. See Refs. 1\u20131 to 1\u20136.\n\u2217The term thrust chamber, used for the assembly of the injector, nozzle, and chamber, is preferred\nby several of\ufb01cial agencies and therefore has been used in this book. For small spacecraft control\nrockets the term thruster (a small thrust chamber) is commonly used, and this term will be used in\nsome sections of this book."}, {"chapter": "Chapter 1", "page": 6, "body": "\nFIGURE 1\u20133.

A nozzle has a converging section, a con-\nstriction or throat, and a conical or bell-shaped diverging section as further\ndescribed in the next two chapters.\nSome liquid rocket engines permit repetitive operation and can be started and\nshut off at will.

The solid propellant\n\u2217Historically, the word engine is used for a liquid propellant rocket propulsion system and the word\nmotor is used for solid propellant rocket propulsion.

Once ignited, it usually burns smoothly at a predetermined rate on all the\nexposed internal surfaces of the grain. Initial burning takes place at the internal\nsurfaces of the cylinder perforation and the four slots. The internal cavity grows\nas propellant is burned and consumed. The resulting hot gas \ufb02ows through the\nsupersonic nozzle to impart thrust. Once ignited, the motor combustion proceeds\nin an orderly manner until essentially all the propellant has been consumed. There\nare no feed systems or valves. See Refs. 1\u20137 to 1\u201310.\nLiquid and solid propellants, and the propulsion systems that use them, are dis-\ncussed in Chapters 6 to 11 and 12 to 15, respectively. Liquid and solid propellant\nrocket propulsion systems are compared in Chapter 19.\nGaseous propellant rocket engines use a stored high-pressure gas, such as air,\nnitrogen, or helium, as their working \ufb02uid or propellant. The stored gas requires\nrelatively heavy tanks. These cold gas engines have been used on many early\nspace vehicles for low thrust maneuvers and for attitude control systems and\nsome are still used today. Heating the gas by electrical energy or by combus-\ntion of certain monopropellants improves the performance and this has often\nbeen called warm gas propellant rocket propulsion. Chapter 7 discusses gaseous\npropellants.\nHybrid propellant rocket propulsion systems use both a liquid and a solid\npropellant. For example, if a liquid oxidizing agent is injected into a combus-\ntion chamber \ufb01lled with a solid carbonaceous fuel grain, the chemical reaction\nproduces hot combustion gases (see Fig. 1\u20136). They are described further in\nChapter 16. Several have \ufb02own successfully."}, {"chapter": "Chapter 1", "page": 9, "body": "\nFIGURE 1\u20136.

The solid propellant rocket booster lifts the missile away from its\nlaunch platform and is discarded after its operation. A small turbojet engine\nsustains the low-level \ufb02ight at nearly constant speed toward the target.\nA ducted rocket, sometimes called an air-augmented rocket, combines the\nprinciples of rocket and ramjet engines; it gives higher performance (speci\ufb01c\nimpulse) than a chemical rocket engine, while operating within the earth\u2019s atmo-\nsphere. Usually the term air-augmented rocket denotes mixing of air with the\nrocket exhaust (fuel rich for afterburning) in proportions that enable the propul-\nsion device to retain the characteristics typifying a rocket engine, for example,\nhigh static thrust and high thrust-to-weight ratio. In contrast, the ducted rocket\noften is like a ramjet in that it must be boosted to operating speed and uses the\nrocket components more as a fuel-rich gas generator (liquid or solid).\nThe principles of the rocket and ramjet can be combined. An example of\nthese two propulsion systems operating in sequence and in tandem and yet\nutilize a common combustion chamber volume as shown in Fig. 1\u20137. The low-\nvolume con\ufb01guration, known as an integral rocket\u2013ramjet, can be attractive in\nair-launched missiles using ramjet propulsion. The transition from the rocket\nto the ramjet requires enlarging the exhaust nozzle throat (usually by ejecting\nrocket nozzle parts), opening the ramjet air inlet\u2013combustion chamber interface,\nand following these two events with the normal ramjet starting sequence.\nA solid fuel ramjet uses a grain of solid fuel that gasi\ufb01es or ablates and\nreacts with air. Good combustion ef\ufb01ciencies have been achieved with a patented\nboron-containing solid fuel fabricated into a grain similar to a solid propellant\nand burning in a manner similar to a hybrid rocket propulsion system."}, {"chapter": "Chapter 1", "page": 10, "body": "\nFIGURE 1\u20137.

After the solid propellant has been consumed in boosting the vehicle to \ufb02ight speed,\nthe rocket combustion chamber becomes the ramjet combustion chamber with air burning\nthe ramjet liquid fuel.\nNuclear Rocket Engines\nTwo different types of nuclear energy sources have been investigated for deliv-\nering heat to a working \ufb02uid, usually liquid hydrogen, which subsequently can\nbe expanded in a nozzle and thus accelerated to high ejection velocities (6000\nto 11,000 m/sec). However, none can be considered fully developed today and\nnone have \ufb02own. They are the \ufb01ssion reactor and the fusion reactor. Both are\nbasically extensions of liquid propellant rocket engines. The heating of the gas is\naccomplished by energy derived from transformations within the nuclei of atoms.\nIn chemical rockets the energy is obtained from within the propellants, but in\nnuclear rockets the power source is usually separate from the propellant.\nIn the nuclear \ufb01ssion reactor rocket, heat can be generated by the \ufb01ssion of\nuranium in the solid reactor material and subsequently transferred to the work-\ning \ufb02uid (see Refs. 1\u201311 to 1\u201313). The nuclear \ufb01ssion rocket is primarily a\nhigh-thrust engine (above 40,000 N) with speci\ufb01c impulse values up to 900 sec.\nFission rockets were designed and tested in the 1960s in the United States and\nalso in the Soviet Union, which today is Russia. Ground tests with hydrogen\nas a working \ufb02uid culminated in a thrust of 980,000 N (210,000 lb force) at a\ngraphite core nuclear reactor power level of 4100 MW with an equivalent altitude-\nspeci\ufb01c impulse of 848 sec and a hydrogen temperature of about 2500 K. There\nwere concerns with the endurance of the materials at the high temperature (above\n2600 K) and intense radiations, power level control, cooling a reactor after oper-\nation, moderating the high-energy neutrons, and designing lightweight radiation\nshields for a manned space vehicle. No further ground tests of nuclear \ufb01ssion\nrocket engines have been undertaken.\nIn recent years there has been renewed interest in nuclear \ufb01ssion rocket propul-\nsion primarily for a potential manned planetary exploration mission. Studies\nhave shown that the high speci\ufb01c impulse (estimated in some studies at 1100\nsec) allows shorter interplanetary trip transfer times, smaller vehicles, and more\n\ufb02exibility in the launch time when planets are not in their optimum relative\nposition. See Refs. 1\u201311 and 1\u201313."}, {"chapter": "Chapter 1", "page": 11, "body": "\nFusion is an alternate way to create nuclear energy, which can heat a working\n\ufb02uid. A number of different concepts have been studied. To date none are feasible\nor practical.\nConcerns about an accident with the inadvertent spreading of radioactive mate-\nrials in the earth environment and the high cost of development programs have\nto date prevented a renewed experimental development of a large nuclear rocket\nengine. Unless there are some new \ufb01ndings and a change in world attitude about\nnuclear radiation, it is unlikely that a nuclear rocket engine will be developed or\n\ufb02own in the next few decades. Therefore no further discussion of it is given in\nthis book.\nElectric Rocket Propulsion\nIn all electric propulsion the source of the electric power (nuclear, solar radiation\nreceivers, or batteries) is physically separate from the mechanism that produces\nthe thrust. This type of propulsion requires a heavy and inef\ufb01cient power sources\nas discussed below. The thrust usually is low, typically 0.005 to 1 N. In order to\nallow a signi\ufb01cant increase in the vehicle velocity, it is necessary to apply the\nlow thrust and thus a small acceleration for a long time (weeks or months) (see\nChapter 17 and Refs. 1\u201314 and 1\u201315).\nOf the three basic types, electrothermal rocket propulsion most resembles\nthe previously mentioned chemical rocket units; propellant is heated electrically\n(by heated resistors or electric arcs), and the hot gas is then thermodynamically\nexpanded and accelerated to supersonic velocity through an exhaust nozzle (see\nFig. 1\u20138). These electrothermal units typically have thrust ranges of 0.01 to 0.5 N,\nwith exhaust velocities of 1000 to 5000 m/sec, and ammonium, hydrogen, nitro-\ngen, or hydrazine decomposition product gases have been used as propellants.\nThe two other types\u2014the electrostatic or ion propulsion engine and the\nelectromagnetic or magnetoplasma engine\u2014accomplish propulsion by differ-\nent principles, and the thermodynamic expansion of gas in a nozzle, as such,\ndoes not apply. Both will work only in a vacuum. In an ion rocket (see Fig. 1\u20139)\na working \ufb02uid (typically, xenon) is ionized (by stripping off electrons), and then\nthe electrically charged heavy ions are accelerated to very high velocities (2000\nto 60,000 m/sec) by means of electrostatic \ufb01elds. The ions are subsequently elec-\ntrically neutralized; they are combined with electrons to prevent the buildup of\na space charge on the vehicle.\nIn the magnetoplasma rocket an electrical plasma (an energized hot gas con-\ntaining ions, electrons, and neutral particles) is accelerated by the interaction\nbetween electric currents and magnetic \ufb01elds and ejected at high velocity (1000\nto 50,000 m/sec). There are many different types and geometries. The Hall-effect\nthruster, which accelerates a plasma, has a good \ufb02ight record in Russia. A simple\npulsed (not continuously operating) electrical propulsion unit with a solid pro-\npellant is shown in Fig. 1\u201310.

Most electric propulsion systems have\nused solar cells for their power supply. Batteries and isotope decay power sources\nhave also been used.\nOne concept is the solar thermal rocket; it has large-diameter optics to concen-\ntrate the sun\u2019s radiation (e.g., by lightweight precise parabolic mirrors or Fresnel\nlenses) onto a receiver or optical cavity.

APPLICATIONS OF ROCKET PROPULSION\nBecause the rocket can reach a performance unequaled by other prime movers,\nit has its own \ufb01elds of application and does not usually compete with other\npropulsion devices. Examples of important applications are given below and\ndiscussed further in Chapter 4.\nSpace Launch Vehicles\nBetween the \ufb01rst space launch in 1957 and the end of 1998 approximately 4102\nspace launch attempts have taken place in the world and all but about 129 were\nsuccessful (see Ref. 1\u201320). Space launch vehicles or space boosters can be clas-\nsi\ufb01ed broadly as expendable or recoverable/reusable. Other bases of classi\ufb01cation\nare the type of propellant (storable or cryogenic liquid or solid propellants), num-\nber of stages (single-stage, two-stage, etc.), size/mass of payloads or vehicles,\nand manned or unmanned.\nEach space launch has a speci\ufb01c space \ufb02ight objective, such as an earth orbit\nor a moon landing. See Ref. 1\u201321. It uses between two and \ufb01ve stages, each\nwith its own propulsion systems, and each is usually \ufb01red sequentially after the"}, {"chapter": "Chapter 1", "page": 15, "body": "\nlower stage is expended. The number of stages depends on the speci\ufb01c space\ntrajectory, the number and types of maneuvers, the energy content of a unit mass\nof the propellant, payload size, and other factors. The initial stage, usually called\nthe booster stage, is the largest and it is operated \ufb01rst; this stage is then separated\nfrom the ascending vehicle before the second-stage rocket propulsion system is\nignited and operated. As will be explained in Chapter 4, adding an extra stage\npermits a signi\ufb01cant increase in the payload (such as more scienti\ufb01c instruments\nor more communications gear).\nEach stage of a multistage launch vehicle is essentially a complete vehicle in\nitself and carries its own propellant, its own rocket propulsion system or systems,\nand its own control system. Once the propellant of a given stage is expended, the\nremaining mass of that stage (including empty tanks, cases, structure, instruments,\netc.) is no longer useful in providing additional kinetic energy to the succeeding\nstages. By dropping off this useless mass it is possible to accelerate the \ufb01nal\nstage with its useful payload to a higher terminal velocity than would be attained\nif multiple staging were not used. Both solid propellant and liquid propellant\nrocket propulsion systems have been used for low earth orbits.\nFigure 1\u201312 shows the Delta IV heavy-lift space launch vehicle at takeoff.\nIts propellants are liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen (LOX/LH2) in all its main\nengines. Its booster engine, the Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne RS-68, is shown\nin Fig. 6\u201310 and data is in Table 11\u20132 and its second-stage engine, the Pratt\n& Whitney Rocketdyne RL 10B-2 LOX/LH2 (24,750 lb thrust) is shown in Fig.\n8\u201317 and data is in Table 8\u20131. The two liquid propellant strap-on booster pods\n(with the same booster engine) are removed for smaller payloads. Figure 1\u201313\nshows the Atlas V space launch vehicle. Its booster engine is the Energomash\nRD-180, it has Aerojet solid propellant strap-on boosters, and the upper stage\nengine is the Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne RL 10A-4-2 LOX/LH2 engine. The\nRussian (Energomash) LOX/kerosene RD-180 engine is shown in Ref. 1\u20132 as its\nFigure 7.10-11 and data is in its Table 7.10-2. In both of these two launch vehicles\nthe payload is carried on top of the second stage and it has its own propulsion\nsystem of small thrusters. Table 1\u20133 gives data of the larger propulsion systems\nof these two U.S. launch vehicles.\nThe U.S. Space Shuttle is one of the older programs and it provided the\n\ufb01rst reusable spacecraft that lands on a runway. Figure 1\u201314 shows the basic\ncon\ufb01guration of the Space Shuttle, which consists of two stages, the booster and\nthe orbiter. It shows all the 67 rocket propulsion systems of the shuttle. The\norbiter is really a reusable combination space launch vehicle, spacecraft, and\nglider for landing. The two solid propellant strap-on rocket motors are the largest\nin existence; they are equipped with parachutes for sea recovery of the burned-out\nmotors. The large LO2/LH2 external tank is jettisoned and expended just before\norbit insertion (see Ref. 1\u201322). Details of several of these Space Shuttle rocket\npropulsion systems are given in Table 1\u20134. The Space Shuttle accomplishes both\ncivilian and military missions of placing satellites in orbit, undertaking scienti\ufb01c\nexploration, supplying a space station, and repairing, servicing, and retrieving\nsatellites."}, {"chapter": "Chapter 1", "page": 16, "body": "\nFIGURE 1\u201312.

It can be seen that\nthe thrust levels are highest for booster or \ufb01rst stages and are relatively high for\nupper stages (thousands of pounds). Only for the attitude control system of the\nvehicle (also called reaction control in Table 1\u20134) are the thrust levels low (from\na fraction of a pound for small spacecraft to as high as about 1000 pounds thrust\nin the Space Shuttle vehicle). Frequent propulsion starts and stops are usually\nrequired in these applications.\nAt the time of this writing (early 2008) for this new 8th edition National\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) had awarded the initial contracts\nfor a new large manned space \ufb02ight vehicle identi\ufb01ed as Ares I. It is intended\nto replace the aging Space Shuttle after about 2012. It is planned to use a large\nsingle 5-segment solid rocket motor as booster propulsion (being developed by\nATK Launch Systems) and the second stage will use a J-2X liquid propellant\nrocket engine with LOX/LH2 propellants (being developed by Pratt & Whitney\nRocketdyne).\nA new set of manned space \ufb02ight vehicles are currently being developed by\nseveral entrepreneurial US and foreign companies, many with their own private\ncapital. They are aimed at the future commercial market of sending tourists\n(for a hefty price) into space and returning them safely back to earth. All are\nbased on reusable spacecraft, some with reusable launch vehicles, some with\nvertical and some with horizontal takeoff or landing. A couple of suborbital \ufb02ights\nhave already been accomplished with professional pilots using a winged vehicle.\nLiquid propellant rocket engines seem to be preferred and many are planned to\nbe reusable. It is too early for determining which of these organizations will be\nsuccessful in commercializing manned space \ufb02ight.\nThe missions and payloads for space launch vehicles are many, such as\nmilitary (reconnaissance satellites, command and control satellites), nonmili-\ntary government [weather observation satellites, global positioning system (GPS)\nsatellites], space exploration (space environment, planetary missions), or com-\nmercial (communication satellites).\nA single stage-to-orbit vehicle, attractive because it avoids the costs and com-\nplexities of staging, has been expected to have improved reliability (simpler\nstructures, fewer components). However, its payload is usually too small. A low\nearth orbit (say 100 miles altitude) can only be achieved with such a vehicle\nif the propellant performance is very high and the structure is ef\ufb01cient and low\nin mass. Liquid propellants such as liquid hydrogen with liquid oxygen were\nusually chosen. To date a large rocket-propelled single stage-to-orbit vehicle has\nnot \ufb02own.\nSpacecraft\nDepending on their missions, spacecraft can be categorized as earth satellites,\nlunar, interplanetary, and trans-solar types, and as manned and unmanned\nspacecraft. Reference 1\u201323 lists over 20,000 satellites and categorizes them as\nsatellites for communications, weather, navigation, scienti\ufb01c exploration, deep"}, {"chapter": "Chapter 1", "page": 22, "body": "\nspace probes, observation (including radar surveillance), reconnaissance and\nother applications. Rocket propulsion is used for both primary propulsion (i.e.,\nacceleration along the \ufb02ight path, such as for orbit insertion or orbit change\nmaneuvers) and secondary propulsion functions in these vehicles. Some of the\nsecondary propulsion functions are attitude control, spin control, momentum\nwheel and gyro unloading, stage separation, and the settling of liquids in tanks.\nA spacecraft usually has a series of different rocket propulsion systems, some\noften very small. For spacecraft attitude control about three perpendicular axes,\neach in two rotational directions, the system must allow the application of pure\ntorque for six modes of angular freedom, thus requiring a minimum of 12\nthrusters. Some missions require as few as 4 to 6 thrusters, whereas the more\ncomplex manned spacecraft have 40 to 80 thrusters in all of its stages. Often\nthe small attitude control rockets must give pulses or short bursts of thrust,\nnecessitating thousands of restarts. See Section 6.7 and Ref. 1\u201324.\nTable 1\u20135 presents a variety of spacecraft along with their weights, missions,\nand propulsion. Although only U.S. launch vehicles are listed in this table, there\nare also launch vehicles developed by France, the European Space Agency, Rus-\nsia, Japan, China, India, and Israel that have successfully launched payloads into\nsatellite orbits. They use rocket propulsion systems that were developed in their\nown countries.\nThe majority of spacecraft have used liquid propellant engines, a few with solid\npropellant boosters. Many spacecraft have operated successfully with electrical\npropulsion for attitude control. Electrical propulsion systems will probably also\nbe used for some primary and secondary spacecraft propulsion missions on long-\nduration space \ufb02ights, as described in Chapter 17.\nMicropropulsion is a relatively new designation. It has been de\ufb01ned as any\nrocket propulsion system that is applicable to small spacecraft with a mass of\nless than 100 kg, or 220 lb. See Ref. 1\u201325. It encompasses a variety of different\npropulsion concepts, such as certain very low thrust liquid mono- and bipropellant\nrocket engines, small gaseous propellant rocket engines, several types of electrical\npropulsion systems, and emerging advanced versions of these. Many are based\non fabrication of very small components (valves, thrusters, switches, insulators,\nor sensors) by micromachining and electromechanical processes.\nMissiles and Other Applications\nMilitary missiles can be classi\ufb01ed as shown in Table 1\u20136. Rocket propulsion for\nnew U.S. missiles uses now almost exclusively solid propellant rocket motors.\nThey can be strategic missiles, such as long-range ballistic missiles (800 to\n9000 km range), which are aimed at military targets within an enemy country, or\ntactical missiles, which are intended to support or defend military ground forces,\naircraft, or navy ships.\nTables 1\u20136 and 1\u20137 show some parameters of rocket propulsion devices\nfor different applications. The selection of the best rocket propulsion system\ntype and design for any given application is a complex process involving many\nfactors, including system performance, reliability, propulsion system size, and\ncompatibility, as described in Chapter 19."}, {"chapter": "Chapter 1", "page": 23, "body": "TABLE 1\u20135.
